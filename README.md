# Mihaly Balas TogglHire Backend Developer Homework

## Notes
- this is my first Go application
- update only works for the Question entity and does not touch the related Options entities in any way, I did not have enough time to fix this

## Usage
An SQLite3 database file named 'toggl-questions.db' is automatically created in 'pkg/db' when first running the app.
Run main.go in cmd/main after installing the dependencies.
